I have used dataset of COVID19 till 16th May 2020 and used it to compare the statistics of India w.r.t. World.

### Comparing both the cases by plotting data.

### Conclusion

* *As you can see in case of total number of cases both the curves going up with quite same rate. If we ignore the magnitude on Y-axis both the curves have almost similar shape*
* *In case of new cases India has still rising edge while when we look at new cases with respect to world it is going somewhat similar as there are similar ups-n-downs after 30th of March*
